# SpellingBeeTrainer
A javascript app to train the user for spelling bee competitions efficiently.

## Motivation
This program was written by Cheng-You Ho for the sake of preparing for the regional English vocabulary competition in Taiwan. The competition format is very similar to that of the Spelling Bee in the US, though the answer is written on paper and there are a lot of questions to be answered. Basically, it's an exam version of the National Spelling Bee.

## How To Use
1. Set up a git folder with `git init`
2. `git clone` this repository
3. Run the application with `npm start`
4. Go to `localhost:3000` and start training!
